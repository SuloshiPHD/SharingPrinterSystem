# SharingPrinterSystem
Developing an FSP program and Java Program to model a system of  several students that share a printer to print documents and two technicians.
One technician refills the paper when it has run out and one technician replaces the toner cartridge when it runs out. In addition, produce a Java implementation
of the printing system, using the appropriate concurrency features. A version of the FSP printing system model as a multi-threaded concurrent Java program, using the appropriate Java concurrency features, e.g. threads, thread groups, monitors. The Printing System's Java classes should implement the behaviour of the equivalent FSP process.
